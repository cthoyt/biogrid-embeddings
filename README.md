# biogrid-node2vec

This repository generates node2vec embeddings for physical molecular interactions in
[BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/).

## üöÄ Usage

Installation of the requirements and running of the build script are handled with `tox`. The current
version of BioGRID is looked up with [`bioversions`](https://github.com/cthoyt/bioversions) so the
provenance of the data can be properly traced. Run with:

```shell
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

The embedding dataframe can be loaded from GitHub with:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = "https://github.com/cthoyt/biogrid-node2vec/raw/main/output/4.4.200/embeddings.tsv"
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep="\t", skiprows=1)
```

The index uses [UniProt](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot) protein identifiers. It skips a line since
this TSV file uses the word2vec format, where the first line says the length and width of the file.
